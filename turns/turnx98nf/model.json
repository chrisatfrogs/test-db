    "research_findings": "<ol> <li><u>On the comparison between the newer models (maskito_v0.1.4_contextSpss10_large and maskito_v0.2.0_contextSpss10_mini)</u> <br/>OThe larger Maskito model (v0.1.4_contextSpss10_large) outperforms the mini Maskito model (v0.2.0_contextSpss10_mini) in almost all rating criteria (linguistic_difference, content_similarity, overall_quality, grammar, readability, implicit_fact_check, identical_information). In the rating criteria (citation_correct and factual_correctness) where the mini Maskito model showed better results, these differences were not found to be significant. The violin plots show that the ratings for the texts produced by the Mini Maskito model were more varied. <br/><b>Overall, the large model has been rated with texts that have consistently better quality than the mini model.</b></li><br/> <li><u>On the comparison between a newer Maskito (maskito_v0.2.0_contextSpss10_mini) model and Maskito_v0.1.0d_contextSpss10 mini from turnx92 (num_sequences=60)</u> <br/>Save for linguistic_difference and overall_quality, the older mini Maskito model performed significantly better in all the criteria rated by the reviewers. Most startling about these significant differences is the underperformance of the newer Maskito mini model with regard to grammar and readability. Similar to the comparison between the large and mini models for this turn, the mini Maskito model showed more variance in quality across the different criteria. <br/><b>While the newer Maskito mini model showed significant improvements in linguistic difference and overall quality, the older Maskito model exhibited better results in all the other rating criteria. </b> </li><br/> <li><u>On the comparison between maskito_v0.1.4_contextSpss10_large and Maskito_v0.1.0_contextSpss10</u> <br/> Overall, the newer Maskito model (v0.1.4) achieved better results across the board. Where the older large Maskito model fared better (in correct citation and factual correctness), the differences were not found to be significant. The distribution plots also show that in general, the newer large Maskito model produced texts which have less variance in quality and can be deemed better for use in production than its older counterpart. <br/><b>The newer Maskito model was found to have more consistent, better rated texts across (almost) all rating criteria than the older large Maskito model.</b> </li><br/></ol>"
