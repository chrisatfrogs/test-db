    "research_findings": "<p>Overall German generated horoscopes (as already seen with regard to the EN translations) cannot be distinguished from the Ströer originals (human written) by our test reviewers.<br/>With respect to certain criteria (like \"style of writing/tone\") the originals were preferred. Generated text are highly likely to match the given topic and tone.<br/>Time periods are rarely realised in the actual texts (with both sources, original and generated). But monthly horoscopes seem to tend to refer to a specific month, as can be seen in texts from both sources.<br/>All in all the data doesn't indicate any reasons why we shouldn't proceed using davinci model with respective prompts to generate horoscopes for daily, weekly and monthly time periods. <ol> <li>List 1 vs. list 4<br/>1 is significantly better with regards to \"readability\", which means the original is preferred but on a high level.</li><li>List 2 vs. list 5<br/>davinci produced weekly horoscopes outperform originals significantly with respect to all criteria but \"readability\" and \"grammar\" (both very good results)</li><li>List 3 vs. list 6<br/>same picture as in 1 vs. 4 but with a stronger tendency to a better readability in the original</li></ol></p>"
