Sometimes it takes a while until you realize that you have been struggling with loneliness. It becomes more and more clear when you are having trouble sleeping or eating well, or when your thoughts keep turning to the past, wanting to cling onto anything that will make you feel loved again. This is also the time where deep down inside, something is telling you that if only things could be different then life would be much better than it is right now. So maybe now it's time for a change? Try not taking those feelings too seriously and just see what happens after an initial step towards a new lifestyle has been taken. The results might surprise you! You are not alone in this world! That constant feeling of being out there by yourself was just because your perspective on everything was skewed from finding happiness in the little things like having someone who puts up with all your mood swings or just hearing about their day-to-day life which seems so carefree compared to yours at times. Get out there and try meeting people for real--maybe even get into some reading groups--and soon enough one conversation will lead into another until before long something like fate brings two kindred spirits together who help each other through each day after realizing how well they understand one another's struggles and challenges...</td></tr><tr> <td class="tg-alz1" rowspan="5">human written (yearly)</td><td class="tg-alz1">Content</td><td class="tg-alz1">Dark and dismal, all about diseases</td><td class="tg-alz1">According to Gemini health horoscope 2023, if we look from the health point of view then the start of this year will be a bit weak. Shri Ketu Maharaj or Ketu will be present in the 5th house, Saturn in the 8th house, Sun in the 7th, and Mars in the 12th house will make you face health issues. During this whole year, according to the position of Rahu-Ketu, there is a strong possibility of getting a stomach disease. For this, you are recommended to stay serious about your health and have good eating habits because if you do not do this then you will face difficulties and you may have to visit the hospital. At the beginning of the year, when Saturn will be in the 8th house and Mars will be in the 12th house, then during that time there will be possibilities of some kind of physical damage, injury or accident, or even surgery, so you need to be careful. Gemini Horoscope 202 reveals that after that in the middle of the year, Jupiter transit in the 11th house and Saturn's presence in the 9th house will make a way for good health, and Rahu transit on the 10th house on 30 October and Ketu transit in the 4th house can lead to some sort of seasonal infection.</td></tr><tr> <td class="tg-0lax">Style of Writing</td><td class="tg-0lax">Jumpy writing, references to different star constellations is confusing<br/><br/>Stylistically and grammatically lacking<br/><br/>long, too complex sentences</td><td class="tg-0lax">According to Cancer Health Horoscope 2023, the beginning of the year will be slightly weak in terms of health.
