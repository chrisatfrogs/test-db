    "research_findings":"<p>For English monthly and yearly horoscopes the results show that davinci \"vanilla\" (list 2 und 5) outperforms the human written baseline as well as the \"instruct beta\" model with respect to all criteria. \"Vanilla\" is significantly better than \"instruct\" with regard to all criteria but \"Ausdruck\" for yearly horoscopes.<br/>The \"instruct\" model still reaches a pretty high level of text quality while being able to generate longer texts than \"vanilla\". Thus, the extended length could be a possible explanation for the lower ratings. Not necessarily indicating a lower text quality. Therefore, further investigation in the actual editing effort of \"instruct\" texts is needed.</p>"
